# API-VulnScan
API VulnScan is a lightweight CLI tool designed to identify common security issues in APIs. It performs the following checks:

Open Endpoints: Detects endpoints accessible without authentication that could expose sensitive data or functionality.
Unsafe HTTP Methods: Checks if endpoints allow unsafe HTTP methods (e.g., PUT, DELETE) that could be exploited.
Missing Security Headers: Verifies the presence of important security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

# Usage 
```cd API-VulnScan```

```python3 api-vulnscan.py```
